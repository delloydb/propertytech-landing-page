# **PropertyTech – Real Estate Listing Website**

Welcome to **PropertyTech**, a professionally designed real estate property listing system. This frontend-only project demonstrates a fully responsive and user-focused web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

- “Write CSS to style a responsive property grid layout with hover effects.”  
- “Create JavaScript for property filter functionality and pagination.”  
- “Suggest UX-friendly multi-step form design for submitting property details.”  
- “Build a blog post layout with related articles and comment sections.”

- “Write a mobile-responsive footer with quick links, social media icons, and newsletter signup.”  
- “Generate a layout template for multi-page real estate website using only HTML and CSS.”  

These prompts helped in building structured, modular, and user-centered interfaces for each section and page of the website.
